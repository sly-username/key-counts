Create an html page with an input field and a button to determine if the input field contains a palindrome. A palindrome is a word or phrase that is spelled exactly the same forwards or backwards, like "pop" or "Ah, Satan sees Natasha". Your code should ignore all non-alphanumeric characters and assume that upper-and lowercase characters are identical. When the button is pressed the the result of whether or not the input is a palindrome should be displayed.
